            <h2>Marine drive beach</h2>Besides the six-lane concrete Marine Drive is the Marine Drive beach. It is much
            clean and clear than the Girgaon Chowpatty beside it. The beach witnesses the Ganpati visarjan and many
            marathons and airshows. The beach and the Marine Drive are a well-known tourist spot of attraction and are
            compared to Miami’s ocean drive. The beach looks beautiful at night as the Queen’s Necklace (Marine Drive)
            glows and is a worth visiting place in Mumbai</p>

            <h2>Juhu Beach</h2>At the top is definitely the expansive Juhu Beach that stretches about 6 km, all the way
            to Versova Beach in Andheri. Once the haunt of the rich and famous, Juhu Beach today is among the best
            places to visit in Mumbai with friends or family and is a big local attraction for both locals and tourists.

            It becomes really colorful and busy during Ganesh Chaturthi when people bring idols of the deity to be
            immersed in the sea here. And yes, it is commercialized on every other day of the year with throngs of
            people, scores of food stalls, horse carriages and sellers, but that’s just part of the fun!</p>

            <h2>Girgaum Chowpatty</h2>Better known as ‘Chowpatty’, this iconic Mumbai beach is situated at the far end
            of the equally iconic Marine Drive and is one of the busiest beaches in Mumbai. Tourists and locals alike
            flock to this sandy shore to admire the glimmering cityscape and the sun setting into the Arabian Sea.

            Although heavily commercialized, Girgaum Chowpatty is still popular because it offers a magical haven for
            beach lovers in the midst of the fast-paced city life. Here you will find office-goers chilling after work,
            families taking a stroll by the sea, young couples (renting beach mats by the hour!), food vendors, and
            hawkers. Go here for a great Mumbai experience and to see what beaches mean to the city.</p>

            <h2>Versova Beach</h2>At the northern end of Juhu is Versova Beach, a quieter arc of sand that adjoins a
            fishing village
            of the same name. One of the loveliest beaches in Mumbai, Versova is known for its swimmable waters, the
            colorful fishing boats, and its breathtaking views of the sun setting into the Arabian Sea.

            Populated mostly by couples and youngsters, Versova Beach is a mix of sandy and rocky landscape and
            considered one of the cleanest beaches in Mumbai. Several interesting cafes and restaurants are in the
            neighborhood, and it is fun to hop into one of those once you’ve had your fill of the beach.
