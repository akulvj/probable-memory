            <h2>Vasai Fort</h2>The city of Mumbai lies on the coastline of Maharashtra and to protect it, many forts
            were constructed in its long history. One of those is the Vasai Fort, also known as Bassein Fort,
            significant militarily to oversee the surrounding areas of Mumbai, Thane and Saashti. Located in the Vasai
            suburb of North Mumbai, the walls of the fort, though in ruins, still have enough in them to make you wonder
            at its architectural marvel. Due to its strategic location, the fort has witnessed many battles. It was
            under the control of the Portuguese army till the early 18th century. The Maratha kingdom, under the
            leadership of Bajirao Peshwa, waged a few battles to claim it for their own. After the initial unsuccessful
            attempt in 1737 to capture Vasai, the Maratha leader Chimajiappa, was handed over this task. A lot of
            research and reconnaissance went into planning the next attack and after a swift and well-planned guerilla
            campaign, the Maratha army finally captured the fort in 1739. The remnants of chapels, watchtowers and
            staircases in the ruins of this fort under the cover of large palm trees tell many stories from that time
            period. Because of its history as a Portuguese settlement, there are a few graves with carvings in Latin and
            remains of an ancient church that can also be seen. The ramparts, arches and watchtowers are hauntingly
            beautiful and many visitors prefer to shoot their wedding photos here. The wild overgrown vegetation as well
            as coconut and palm tree cover adds to the beauty of the wilderness. There are a few trails that let you go
            up to the edge of the fort from where gorgeous views of the Ulhas river and the setting sun can be seen. The
            fort has also been used as a location for many Bollywood films like Josh, Khamoshi and Ram Gopal Verma Ki
            Aag. </p>

            <h2>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus</h2>A monument of significant historical importance that houses one
            of the finest railway stations in the world, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus sees a footfall of
            over 3 million daily. The railway terminus was named Victoria Terminus in honour of the British Queen,
            Victoria, on Golden Jubilee Day (1887) to mark fifty years of her reign. It was subsequently renamed as
            Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus in 1996 to honour the founder of the Maratha empire and is currently known as
            Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (as of 2017). This was the very first terminus station in the
            subcontinent. British architects joined hands with Indian craftsmen to build this heritage building, an
            outstanding example of Victorian Gothic revival architecture blending with themes derived from traditional
            Indian architecture, thereby forging a style unique to then-Bombay. Designed by British architect F W
            Stevens, this heritage structure is known for its magnificent stone dome, cantilevered staircase, ornamental
            turrets, elegant columns, pointed arches, high vaulted ceilings and a host of expansive decorative
            sculptures and carvings. The main gate of the building is flanked by two columns, with sculptures of a
            seated lion representing Britain atop one and a crouching tiger representing India on the other. The facade
            has snarling heads of gargoyles jutting out, leaping griffins, peacock with its feathers open like a fan and
            a cobra locked in a fight with a mongoose. Because of its elaborate, intricate and three-dimensional stone
            carved decor, the terminus took almost 10 years to build. Mumbai, known as the city of dreams, opens its
            gates to a multitude of people every day and a large part of these people arrive on trains. The majestic and
            awe-inspiring Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus is the first structure that they usually see and many
            have written of the overwhelming effect this massive heritage site has on them. </p>

            <h2>Elephanta Caves</h2>One of the best things about Mumbai is the sea and the access it provides for quick
            day-time trips to nearby beaches and islands. Less than an hour's boat ride from the Gateway of India, in
            Colaba, lies the Elephanta Island colloquially known as Gharapuri or the Fortress City. The scenic island
            stretches across 10 to 15 sq km of land and has a dense foliage of mango, tamarind and palm trees. Perfect
            for a weekend excursion, this island provides good trekking as well as picnic opportunities. The island gets
            its name from a giant stone sculpture of an elephant that was discovered by the 16th century Portuguese
            explorers who came to this area. The island owes its global popularity to the fact that it is home to a
            network of ancient rock-cut caves known as the Elephanta caves that boast artistic wall carvings and
            sculptures, dedicated to Hindu and Buddhist gods. These caves were incorporated in the UNESCO list of World
            Heritage sites in the early 1980s. The walls of the caves, which are located on top of a hillock, are lined
            with rock art that experts say, dates as far back as the mid- 5th and 6th century. There are two main hills
            on the island â€“ Gun Hill and Stupa Hill. The former gets its name from the two British-era canons perched on
            it and the latter because of the remains of a Buddhist stupa that was excavated here. The most intricately
            detailed and architecturally majestic cave, among the Elephanta network is situated on Gun Hill. The panels
            on these caves depict the lives and beliefs of the esoteric Pashupati sect of the Shaiva system. A 7-m-high
            sculpture called Sadashiva lies at the entrance of the cave. </p>

            <h2>Gateway Of India</h2>A great historical monument, true to its name, the Gateway of India is often the starting point for tourists who visit Mumbai. An integral visual seen in most skyline photographs of Mumbai, this monument is visited by millions of people across the world. As the oft-repeated saying goes 'When in Mumbai, do what the films actors do' and in the same vein, many tourists can be seen clicking photos of each other while running in exaggerated styles through the mass of pigeons that are often pecking on seeds in the courtyard of this heritage structure. This structure was built as a triumphal arch to commemorate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to Bombay and is today synonymous with the imagery associated with Mumbai. The archway is 26 m high and joined with four turrets, with intricate lattice work carved on stones. The arch alone was built at the cost of INR 21 lakh. It is built in Indo-Saracenic style, though some influence of Gujarati style is also evident in its architecture. In the past, Gateway of India used to be the arrival point for visitors from the west. Ironically, when the British raj ended in 1947, this colonial symbol also became a sort of epitaph: the last of the British ships that set sail for England left from the Gateway. This majestic landmark of Mumbai faces the vast Arabian Sea and is a must-visit at night, all lit up in its pristine glory against the backdrop of the sea. For those who have a few hours to spare, there are private yachts that can be booked at the Gateway of India to sail away with the setting sun casting the perfect golden glow over the glittering Mumbai skyline.
