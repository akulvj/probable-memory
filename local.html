            <h2>Seafood Specialities</h2>Mumbai is a coastal city with a long history of fish trade as the city's
            natives were kolis or fishermen. For this reason, seafood is an essential culinary item that forms an
            important part of Mumbai cuisine. Some of the main seafood items offered in Mumbai include fish koliwada,
            tisriya masala, prawn tikki, fish thali, chanok fish fry, bangda tikhale, surmai fish curry etc. One main
            dish to try in Mumbai is the bombil fish fry or Bombay duck, which is actually a fish found aplenty in the
            waters around the city. It is crunchy on the outside and succulent on the inside. To prepare this, the fish
            is first flattened, then dipped in a batter of gram flour enriched with spices, and finally fried. It can be
            eaten as a meal in itself or can be served with rotis (Indian flatbread).

            <h2>Zhunka bhakar</h2>This dish has deep roots in the farming and working-class communities of interior
            Maharashtra. Considered the common man's food, a political decision was made at the highest echelons of
            government to make it available everywhere. Overnight, thousands of zhunka bhakar stalls opened, none
            pricing it at more than 15 cents (Rs 10). Traditionally, the zhunka is made using chopped onions tempered
            with mustard seeds and kadipatta leaves mixed with chickpea flour and is dry. It is eaten with jowar
            (millet) bhakri or roti.
            Try the stalls opposite Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (originally called Victoria Terminus) and BMC
            Headquarters.

            <h2>Kolhapuri mutton</h2> The hotter the temperature of a city, the hotter the food. And it's true of this
            mutton dish that has its roots in Kolhapur, a city in the south of Maharashtra. It comes in two coconut
            based gravy variations. The nuclear strength version is called tambda rassa (a red chili-spiced
            extravaganza). And the milder version is called pandhara rassa (yoghurt, cashew nuts and raisin
            embellished). Both go well with either rotis or rice when you're in the mood for a feast.
            Taste the heat at Purepur Kolhapur, 1, Aditya Apartments, Parleshwar Road, Parleshwar Mandir, Vile Parle

            <h2>Puran poli</h2>A festive dish made by Maharashtrians and Gujaratis especially during Holi (to celebrate
            the end of the winter season) and Dussehra (to celebrate the triumph of Lord Ram over the demon Raavan). It
            is made by simmering chana dal (yellow gram) with sugar or jaggery (molasses or gur) till it dries up, and
            then hand-grinding to smooth it out. Nutmeg and cardamom powders are the flavorings. Palm-sized balls of the
            paste are stuffed into wheat flour dough and rolled out to be roasted on a tawa frying pan with a little
            ghee (clarified butter). Do add a lot of ghee when you're eating them, they taste tops then.
            Puran polis can be found in some grocery stores but they are a poor mass-produced version of the real thing.
            The real ones can only be found in a Maharashtrian or Gujarati home.</p>
