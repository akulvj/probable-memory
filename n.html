            <h2>Playboy Club</h2>Following the footsteps of its global outposts, Playboy Club in Mumbai is a glamorous
            bar with a mysterious décor. Complementing the anything-can-happen-here vibe is the upbeat music by local
            and international DJs. The club is only open on Friday and Saturday evenings and charges a fee for entry
            (that won’t give you access to tables, though). As the place gets crowded, reaching the bar to grab a drink
            might prove difficult. May we suggest pregaming instead?<br>
