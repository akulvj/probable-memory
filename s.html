            <h2>Ganeshpuri Temple</h2>Once a dense forestland inhabited by a few tribal communities, Ganeshpuri was
            transformed into a spiritual centre by spiritual leader, Nityanand Swami. The place has a Shiva temple, a
            few natural hotwater springs and several other temples. Of the many hot springs, a few are open to the
            public with bathhouses built around them. In its twin town, Vajreshwari, the Vajreshwari Temple is quite
            significant. It is dedicated to Goddess Vajreshwari, who is an incarnation of Goddess Parvati. The temple
            was built by the Peshwas after winning back the Vasai Fort from the Portuguese. It is situated at the
            foothills of the Mandakini Hills, which were formed out of a volcanic eruption. This also explains the
            numerous mineral-rich springs in the area. A flight of fifty odd steps leads to the temple perched on the
            top of a small hillock.

            <h2>Siddhivinayak Temple</h2>A Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Ganesha, the Shree Siddhivinayak Ganapati
            Temple at Prabhadevi is a much revered place of worship in Mumbai. Built in the year 1801, this temple is
            visited by people belonging to almost all sects of the society. The temple has a small mandapam (hall),
            where the main idol is enshrined. Boasting an exquisite architecture, the sanctum sanctorum has been fitted
            with wooden doors that have been meticulously carved with the images of the Ashtavinayaka or the eight
            manifestations of Lord Ganesha. In what is considered an unusual imagery, the temple’s idol was carved out
            of a single black stone with the trunk positioned towards the right, as opposed to the more commonly seen
            left-side curl. The idol has four hands known as Chaturbhuj. The upper right holds a lotus while the upper
            left hand holds a small axe. A bowl full of modaks (an Indian sweet), along with holy beads can also be
            seen. The upper floors of the temple host the residential quarters of its priests. Though the temple remains
            crowded throughout the week, it receives the maximum number of devotees on Tuesdays. On each side of the
            Ganesha idol are placed one idol each of Goddesses Riddhi and Siddhi, who symbolise sanctity, success,
            wealth and prosperity. The name 'Siddhivinayak' literally translates to Ganesha who grants your wish. In the
            periphery, there is a Hanuman temple as well. One of the narrow lanes that lead up to the temple is called
            the phool gali and has a large number of vendors selling flower garlands, tulsi (basil) leaves, coconuts and
            sweets, which can be offered to the god.

            <h2>Haji Ali Mosque</h2>One of the more popular attractions of Mumbai, the Haji Ali complex houses the tomb
            of Muslim saint, Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari, and a mosque. Popular with photographers, this iconic monument
            can be seen from the shores of Mumbai and lies entirely on an island in the Arabian Sea, at a distance of
            about 500 yards from the mainland. According to legend, the saint was travelling to the holy city of Mecca,
            in present day Saudi Arabia, on a pilgrimage, when he passed away. His casket floated across the Arabian Sea
            and landed up along the coast of Mumbai, where a mosque was built around it. The structure has white domes
            and minarets reminiscent of Mughal architecture and is a renowned pilgrimage and tourist site popular with
            both Muslims and non-Muslims. Adjacent to the mosque is an 85-foot-tall marble minaret. Both the mosque and
            the minaret are made out of pure white solid marble with carvings and engravings, adorned with beautiful
            mirror work. An oft-repeated belief here is that whoever prays to saint Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari won't ever
            be disappointed. The monument is an oasis of peace and serenity, floating in the gentle blue waters of the
            sea, away from the chaos of the mainland. Live qawwali and sufi music performances take place on the premise
            on most afternoons. Thursdays and Fridays are special days at the dargah and there is a greater surge of
            devotees on these days. Those visiting here often offer prayers and ask for the fulfilment of their wishes
            and seek blessings from the saint in whose honour this site was constructed. On special religious occasions
            like Urs (death anniversary of the saint) and Eid (Islamic religious festival), this heritage monument is
            beautifully decorated and Islamic rituals are observed.

            <h2>Mahalaxmi Temple</h2>The Mahalaxmi Temple is an ancient shrine dedicated to Goddess Laxmi, Goddess
            Mahakali and Goddess Mahasaraswati, whose idols are adorned with resplendent jewellery, including nose
            rings, pearl necklaces and gold bangles. This beautiful temple overlooking the Arabian Sea at one end of
            Breach Candy, now known as Bhulabhai Desai Road, is in a trendy residential and shopping area. One of the
            oldest temples in the city, the Mahalaxmi Temple is renowned for its exquisite architecture and intricate
            designs. The main doorway leading to the temple complex is luxuriously ornamented attracting not only
            pilgrims but also avid photographers. The temple was built between the 16th and 17th centuries. Several
            stalls stationed outside the temple sell items used in the worship of the goddesses.</p>

            <h2>Basilica Of Our Lady Of The Mount Church</h2>This 100-year-old Roman Catholic basilica located on a hillock in Bandra overlooks the Arabian Sea. It attracts devotees from all faiths who come to pray and seek blessings from Mother Mary. The church has been built in the Neo-Gothic style of architecture. There are seven steps in white marble that lead the eye of the visitor to the statue of Mother Mary holding her son Jesus Christ in her right hand. The wooden statue is crowned with a white and gold veil that flows down to the topmost marble step. The murals depict scenes from the life of Mary. Although the current church edifice is relatively modern, the history behind the statue of Our Lady goes back to the 16th century when Jesuit priests from Portugal brought the statue to the current location and constructed a chapel. A week-long festival takes place here in September to celebrate Mother Mary’s birthday. Known as the Bandra Fair, thousands of devotees come here during that time to partake in the festive activities that take place in and around the beautifully decorated church. Many stalls selling religious artefacts, curios, candles and baked goodness are also set up.
