            <h2>Vada Pav</h2>Colloquially known as vada pav, it is a type of Indian burger that is made from boiled
            potato
            stuffing dipped in gram flour batter and deep fried then served on a bun or a bread slice. It is relished by
            locals and tourists alike and is considered soul-food by Mumbaikars. It is believed to have been invented by
            Ashok
            Vaidya in 1966, who opened a small stall serving this snack, opposite to the Dadar train station. Thousands
            of
            workers often looking for a quick and cheap snack would flock to his stall. Soon, vada pav became a hit with
            not
            just workers but most people of the city. Today, every street corner of Mumbai has a vendor selling vada
            pav.</p>

            <h2>Pani Puri</h2>Pani puri is a common street snack in several cities of India. It is made from flour,
            which
            is fried into puffed balls, and then filled with spiced cumin and mint water, onions, potatoes and
            chickpeas.
            This delicious snack has a legend associated with it and it is said that the recipe of the dish dates back
            to
            the Mahabharata era. As the story goes, when Draupadi married the five Pandava brothers, in order to test
            her
            household skills, their mother Kunti, gave her all the vegetables in the house along with a little dough to
            make a meal for the family. Then, Draupadi made a dish very similar to the pani puri that we eat today. </p>

            <h2>Pav Bhaji</h2>This Maharashtrian delicacy is served in almost all big hotels and roadside eateries, and
            has a savoury taste. It is a thick vegetable curry made from seasonal vegetables, potatoes, tomatoes and
            onions served with pav, which is bread roll topped with butter. It is best served hot. The word 'pav' comes
            from the Portuguese word for bread and 'bhaji' in Marathi means a vegetable dish.

            Pav Bhaji is said to have originated in the state of Maharashtra as a midnight meal for textile workers in
            the 1850s. As the story goes, since the mill workers worked late into the night, their wives would feel
            annoyed when they got home and asked for dinner. Thus, to make a filling meal, they started collecting
            leftover bread and mixing all the vegetables and mashing them. This was a rough version of the delectable
            pav bhaji that is relished today.

            <h2>Bhelpuri</h2>A fast-food savoury snack made from puffed rice, onions, tomatoes, cucumber and tangy
            tamarind sauce, it is mostly available as chaat (savoury snack) at the beachside eateries and the alleys of
            Mumbai and relished by locals and visitors alike. Legend has it that chaat was first made in the kitchens of
            Mughal emperor Shah Jahan when his doctor advised him to eat light and spicy foods.

            While the exact origins of bhel puri are unknown, many believe that it was brought to Mumbai by a Gujarati
            migrant. There is an interesting tale associated with this scrumptious snack. It says that during British
            rule in India, a famous chef, William Harold, was sent to help with the meal preparations for the troops.
            Since he was so good, he was soon promoted to the cook of a high-ranking official. It so happened that the
            officer ordered Harold to make him a local recipe and he learnt how to make bhel puri, which was made of
            puffed rice and potatoes. It so impressed the soldiers that the officer asked Harold to look for more local
            recipes. It is said that the chef could not find any more recipes and when he told his officer that he would
            be eating french fries that night, the officer was so enraged that he shot Harold in the head.
